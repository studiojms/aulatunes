### Toggle favorite

Toggle favorite is a new feature added to the application. It allows users to mark each album as a favorite by clicking on it.
There's a new icon added to each album, next to the title, that indicates if the album is marked as favorite or not (filled image is favorite, empty image is not).

### Next steps

Nowadays it is only possible to mark an album as a favorite, but they aren't yet searchable. An evolution that could add more value to the user is to improve filters regarding favorites/non-favorites albums.
